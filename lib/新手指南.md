### Q2: My math formulas aren’t showing up?

**A:** Please check the following:

1. Is your formula syntax correct?  
2. Inline formulas must be wrapped in single dollar signs, like: `$E=mc^2$`  
3. Block formulas need double dollar signs or bracket notation  
4. Try refreshing the page

## 🎯 Tips & Best Practices

### 📝 File Naming Tips

Good filenames save you time! (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

**Recommended naming styles:**
- `2024-01-15-PythonBasics.md` (with date)  
- `DataStructures-LinkedListNotes.md` (category + topic)  
- `Project-MarkiNoteDevLog.md` (project + description)

**Not recommended:**
- `Untitled.md` ❌  
- `New Text Document.md` ❌  
- `asdfgh.md` ❌

### 📂 Folder Structure Suggestions

A thoughtful folder structure makes everything easier to find! (★ ω ★)

### 🎨 Markdown Writing Tips

1. **Use heading hierarchy**: Structure your docs with `#`, `##`, `###`  
2. **Leverage lists**: Lists make content clearer  
3. **Specify language in code blocks**: Better highlighting!
